#### Requirements
* Create a front end experience that allows a user to create a Task.
* When the Task is created, it should be stored inside of a database (SQL)
* Whenever a Task is created the front end should refresh to show all tasks that need to be completed.
* Each Task should have an option to 'Complete' or 'Delete'.
* When a Task is complete, its visual representation should change on the front end. For example, the background of the task container could change from gray to green. The complete option should be  'checked off'. Each of these are accomplished in CSS, but will need to hook into logic to know whether or not the task is complete.
* Whether or not a Task is complete should also be stored in the database.
* Deleting a Task should remove it both from the front end as well as the Database.

* background color of the page
* font family and size
* text color & or background color of tasks to show whether or not they have been completed

--create input and submit button in html
--submit button should take string value from taskInput, send it (via POST?) from JS, thru the router and server to the database 
--the same submitBtn function should POST the updated "To Do" list to the DOM
--each task should have a "Complete" btn and a "Delete" btn
--"Complete" btn should change the task field in TABLE to a different color, signifying that it's done. (maybe add a check mark?? small print saying "done!"??)
